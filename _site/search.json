    "text": "Urbanisation has been a top priority for many countries given the economic growth and development it paves way for. Within the South-East Asian context, we understand that apart from Singapore, Malaysia has been undergoing rapid urbanisation, with its urbanisation rate being 77.1% in 2023 and a projected 81.8% in 2030 given an annual urban growth rate of 1.8%. In particular, we observe that KL is currently the largest urban area in the country, generating almost 51% of Malaysia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and will continue to urbanise as the capital of the country.\nUnfortunately, this overgrowing urbanisation has been a major contributor to the natural disasters that have been happening in the country and the state. The productivity and consequent economic contribution that has been happening as a result of greater urbanisation in KL over the past years has often come at the expense of existing natural and ecological resources, leading to flash floods and landslides.\nIn order to understand why this may be the case, it is necessary to first understand what landslides and flash floods are. Landslides are environmental disasters that occur due to the mass movement of material, such as rock, earth or debris, down a slope, whereas flash floods refers to flooding caused by excessive rainfall in a short period of time (6 hours or less).\nWhile urbanisation activities often contribute to various detrimental environmental phenomena, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in particular contributes to higher occurrences of extreme rainfall. This rainfall is triggered by the rapid rise of moist air in the atmosphere (a result of the sun heating the Earth’s surface) and often causes intense, localised short-duration rainfall that leads to flash floods.\nIn the scenario where these flash floods occur, the soil and ground are exposed (often for a prolonged period of time) to rainfall, which saturates it. This reduces its strength and cohesion, leading to slope instability and consequent failure. Additionally, rapid infiltration of water into the soil rapidly increases the water pressure in the ground which the soil is unable to reduce, also resulting in slope instability.\nEven if flash floods are not present, actions such as deforestation and illegal logging that are carried out to make way for urban sprawl and development are often not coupled with sufficient compensatory practices, leading to slope, vegetation and drainage disruptions and instabilities. This eventually leads to landslides as the soil and ground erodes and falls.\nGiven this information, we believe that there is an important topic of discussion to be tackled: how the urbanisation, environmental degradation and consequent selected natural disasters have contributed to land cover changes in the past 5 years. We hope that this analysis will better flesh out the cause-and-effect relationship of these disasters with overall urban development and planning, paving the way for a more sustainable approach to urbanisation and infrastructure/economic growth moving forward.\n##Project Objectives\nThis project seeks to investigate and analyse land cover changes in KL by drawing links between landslides alongside accompanying natural phenomena such as floods and changes in various land classes. The specific objectives of the study are as follows:\n\n\nTo detect land cover changes in Kuala Lumpur across the selected time period (2020 to 2024) by using GIS tools to wrangle and analyse satellite imagery and geospatial data.\n\n\n\nTo visualise and classify major land cover categories and identify significant trends in these categories across the span of 5 years (2020 to 2024).\n\n\n\nTo explore, implement, and evaluate appropriate classification methods for land cover analysis within the selected KL boundary.\n\n\n\nTo understand and excavate meaningful insights that aid in understanding the environmental implications of land use changes in relation to urbanisation.\n\n\n\n\nSince this project will be focusing on land cover changes in different land classes across a span of 5 years, we will be utilising open-source data platforms such as Copernicus and OSM to obtain our data files and layers to perform remote sensing. After selecting our preferred area of study and collecting necessary data, we will wrangle, prepare and split the data into training and testing samples to classify into the various land classes using SCP. Then, we will analyse the results obtained to identify key changes in land cover for each class. Furthermore, to obtain better knowledge on the subject and provide depth to our findings, we have also conducted research and literature reviews to supplement our analysis."

    "text": "Abstract\nBeyond Singapore, other south-east asian countries have been undergoing rapid urbanisation and development in order to propel economic growth. Namely, Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur (“KL”) has been on the rise in terms of urbanisation and consequently, this has led to a greater proclivity to natural disasters such as landslides and flash floods due to environmental degradation. Studies show that Malaysia has been extremely prone to landslide occurrences and is the 10th country with the highest frequency of landslides. Currently, KL has been the greatest contributor to this figure in Malaysia given its rapid urbanisation. \nTherefore, we are interested in analysing the effects of landslides and any accompanying phenomena such as flash floods on the changes in land cover that have occurred in KL over the span of 5 years (2020 to 2024). \nIn this project, we have utilised Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data obtained from Copernicus to perform remote sensing by means of image processing and classification techniques. Additionally, we sourced our vector layers and baseline land cover information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and delineated sub-regions within KL using Mukim boundary layers for further specific analysis. \nAfter creating any and all layers, we defined 8 different land classes (Natural Vegetation, Managed Vegetation, Water Body, Impervious Surfaces, Built-Up (low-rise buildings), Built-Up (high-rise buildings), Barren Land, Shadow). We then obtained the necessary training and testing samples from these land classes to perform classification using the Semi-Classification Plugin (SCP) and observe changes in specific land classes (Natural Vegetation, Managed Vegetation, Water Body, Impervious Surfaces, Built-Up (low-rise buildings), Barren Land). \nFrom our classification and subsequent observations, we were able to find the following: \n\nThere was an overall increasing trend in Managed Vegetation composition.\nThere was an overall decreasing trend in Natural Vegetation as well as Impervious Surfaces composition.\nThere was considerable variation in Barren Land and Water Bodies composition.\n\nNotably, we observed sharp increases and decreases in the different land classes from 2023 to 2024, which we believe can be attributed to a major landslide that occurred in Bukit Tunku, KL in April 2023. The overall results also allowed us to observe the varying levels of accuracies across the years, with 2024 having the greatest classification accuracy (Overall Accuracy = 81.3%, Kappa Hat = 0.759) and 2022 having the lowest classification accuracy (Overall Accuracy = 40.4%, Kappa Hat = 0.286). We will dive deeper into our observations and takeaways in the following sections of the report."

However, we were unable to obtain these values for many of the years despite taking multiple training/test samples that were distributed across the selected region, which could therefore mean that the accuracy defect was due to poor image quality for selected years. Such shortcomings will be further elaborated in the Limitations section."
