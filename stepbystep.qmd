# Step-by-Step

### 1.1 Viewing all Sentinel-2 satellite data for KL for 2020-2024

Why Sentinel-2 over Landsat8 for Land Cover Change Analysis?

Both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data are excellent, but Sentinel-2 is preferred for land cover mapping, especially for dynamic urban areas like Kuala Lumpur and its 10m resolution better captures smaller urban features like roads and buildings, as well as fine-scale deforestation. Landsat 8’s 30m resolution often mixes land covers like trees and roads together, causing misclassification.

However, since Sentinel-2 is a relatively newer system, for long-term studies, Landsat has a much larger archive, and 30m resolution would be sufficient if the study was on a continental/much larger scale, requiring large area mapping.

-   Hover over ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%204.31.29%20PM.png){width="81"}at the top right and change Basemaps to OSM Background

-   Drag and zoom in to your location of interest, Kuala Lumpur

-   Hover over ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%204.33.36%20PM.png){width="43" height="38"} and click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%204.34.35%20PM.png){width="43" height="37"}.

-   Select and draw a rectangle, covering the area of Kuala Lumpur completely

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%204.37.16%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   On the left of the screen, select the SEARCH tab

-   Check SENTINEL-2, MSI, L2A, and drag the cloud cover to 50% (this is to only show images that have less than 50% of the image covered by clouds)

    The reason only L2A is check is because it is atmospherically corrected and a cloud mask layer is added, with improved accuracy for ground features as compared to class L1C.

### 1.2 Downloading datasets

#### 1.2.1 Select and download satellite data with lowest cloud cover and temporal consistency

To choose suitable images for temporal analysis in this study, we should be prioritising similar acquisition dates and low cloud cover. Having similar acquisition dates (images from around the same month per year, e.g. March) allows us to compare same-season images to minimise seasonal effects like monsoon season and ensure there is sufficient time between years for land cover change to happen (e.g. images from November 2020 and January 2021 would be relatively similar as only 3 months has passed, and no meaningful information can be extracted). Prioritise low to no cloud cover to ensure that the ground area is visible and are not covered by clouds and their shadows. Also, both images that piece to form Kuala Lumpur should be as close to the same date as possible, to ensure consistent image.

-   Take note of usable images, then compare them across the years, before selecting images of similar months to be used for analysis.

-   For this study, we have chosen the following images:

-   2020: 28 Feb 500 (M) 28 Feb 500 (R)

## 2 Data Extraction and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Creating Project

-   From Window Desktop, launch QGIS

    -   You will start a new QGIS project.

-   From the menu bar, select ‘Project –\> New’

-   Select ‘Project –\> Save As..’ ,  create a project name and ensure it is saved in QGIS XML Project format (\*.QGIS)

### 2.2 Extracting KL shapefile

-   To add the shapefiles to QGIS, from the menu bar, select ‘Layer’ → ‘Add Layer’ → ‘Add Vector Layer…’

-   From the dataset downloaded for 2020, choose the file ‘geoBoundaries-MYS-ADM2_simplified.shp’ and click ‘Add’

-   From the dataset downloaded for 2021, choose the file ‘geoBoundaries-MYS-ADM3_simplified.shp’ and click ‘Add’

-   Select and view the 2020 layer, then click on the dropdown beside found on the overlay panels, click ‘Select Feature(s)’ and select the KL polygon

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%205.49.17%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%205.49.53%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

-   Next, right-click the layer  ExportSave selected features as…

-   Save it as a Shapefile format named ‘KL’ and change CRS to EPSG:4751, click ‘OK’

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.26.21%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   From the menu bar, select ‘Vector’ → ‘Geoprocessing Tools’ → ‘Clip…’

-   Select the 2021 layer as input layer and ‘KL’ as overlay and click OK,  you should see the image below. Save it as shapefile called ‘KLMap (with subzone)’. Remove all other layers

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.28.11%20PM.png){width="1000"}

### 2.3 Extracting KL map from Sentinel-2 data

-   To add the Sentinel-2 files to QGIS, from the menu bar, select ‘Layer’ → ‘Add Layer’ → ‘Add Raster Layer…’

-   Click the ‘…’ button and browse for 2020, the sentinel folder containing  the ‘Left’ image of KL, for bands 2, 3, 4 and 8 under the ‘10m’ folder. Click ‘Open’, then click ‘Add’ and ‘Close’. Do so for the ‘Right’ image for KL also. You should be seeing something like that in your screen.

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.46.40%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   We want to combine these two images, so from the menu bar, select ‘Raster’ → ‘Miscellaneous → ‘Build Virtual Raster…’

-   Under input layer, click "..." and select two images of the same bands, then click ‘Run’

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.48.02%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   A virtual layer will appear as shown below

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.49.26%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   Next, we will clip out only the area we are interested in, which is the KL area

-   From the menu bar, select ‘Raster’ → ‘Extraction’→ ‘Clip Raster by Mask Layer…’

-   Put the ‘Virtual’ layer as Input layer and the ‘KLMap (with subzone)’ as Mask layer and click ‘Run’

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.51.40%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   You will then see this

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.53.07%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   Right click the layer → Export → Save As…. Save it in GeoTIFF format called ‘2020-0228-B02’ and remove the clipped and virtual layers

-   Do so for all 4 bands for the year

## 3 Processing Remote Sensing Images

### 3.1 Creating True Composite Images and False Composite Images from extracted images

Next, we want to create True and False Composite Images to distinguish urban areas from bare soil and highlighting vegetation:

-   From the menu bar, select ‘Plugins’ → ‘Managed and Install Plugins…’, search and install ‘Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin’

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.58.10%20PM.png)

-   Once installed, click on ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.59.09%20PM.png){width="43"}, and a panel called ‘SCP Dock’ will pop up below the ‘Browser’ panel

-   ·      Click on ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%206.59.56%20PM.png){width="43"} and a window will pop up. Click on it again and click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.00.33%20PM.png){width="43"} to create a band set. Name the set as ‘2020’ and click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.01.26%20PM.png){width="43"} on the right side and add layers 2,3,4 and 8 into the set. Finally, click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.02.03%20PM.png){width="43"}.

-   Going back to the project view,  under the same panel, type in ‘3-2-1’ and ‘Enter’ ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.03.21%20PM.png){width="43" height="8"}.

-   A Virtual Band Set will pop up, showing the True Composite Image for the band set

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.04.30%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   Export the band set as a GeoTIFF image, but change the output mode as a Rendered Image. Save it as ‘2020-TCI’![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.08.33%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   Now change the virtual band set to ‘4-3-2’ and you will get a False Colour Composite of the map like this. Save it accordingly too as ‘2020-FCC’

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.09.19%20PM.png){width="1000"}\

### 3.2 Using SCP plugin to do supervised classification for the map, categorising by various land cover types

Next, instead of classifying each land cover type manually, we will be training the model to classify it for us. Upon preliminary analysis of both TCI and FCC, we can determine a few land cover types: Natural Vegetation, Managed Vegetation, Water Body, Impervious Surfaces, Built-up 1 (low-rise), Built-up 2 (high-rise), Barren Land, and Shadow

-   Under the SCP Dock, go to the ‘Training Input’ tab ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.11.20%20PM.png){width="43"} .  Click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.11.52%20PM.png){width="43"} to create a new training input. Name it ‘2020-Train’

-   Select  ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.12.54%20PM.png){width="43"} on the panel near the top of the project to start creating polygons for training. Left click to create points and right click at the end to close off the polygon. At the bottom of the SCP Dock, once you have created the polygon,  you should edit the MCID (Macro class index) and the CID (Class index) to classify the area you have selected properly. For example, I have selected an area of forest, I will classify it as follows:

-   ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.13.42%20PM.png)

-   Here are the MCID and CID we have used to group our areas:

-   Try to use these as guidelines:

    -   Number of points should be proportional to the area in the location covered by said MCID (If forest covers 20%, forest should have around 20% the number of points compared to total)

    -   Try to select far away points even if macro-classes are the same to ensure fair distribution of points and different reflectance values, and left and right of the map (since it is pieced using two separate satellite images (70% L 30% R image)and reflectance might differ slightly)

    -   Number of points for Training data to test data should be about 70% to 30%

    -   Try to select a bigger area and not just a few pixels, as it would be hard for the model to distinguish

    -   After classifying them, to add each polygon into your training input, click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.15.45%20PM.png){width="43"} and a black area will show in its place, indicating that the area has been cut out.

-   Our Macro classes and Classes identified (with examples):

    -   Train data

    -   MCID,CID

    -   1 Natural Vegetation

    -   1.1 Forest :

        ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.17.46%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   2 Managed Vegetation

        -   2.1 Golf course grass

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.19.00%20PM.png){width="1000"}

        -   2.2 Sports field

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.19.52%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   3 Water Body

        -   3.1 Flood Reservoir

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.21.27%20PM.png){width="1000"}

        -   3.2 Lakes

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.22.21%20PM.png){width="1000"}

        -   3.3 Rivers

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.23.06%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   4 Impervious Surfaces

        -   4.1 Roads:

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.24.34%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   5 Built-up 1 (low-rise)

        -   5.1 Houses

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.26.12%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   6 Built-up 2 (high-rise)

        -   6.1 Buildings (High-rise buildings are typically accompanied by shadows)

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.27.49%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   7 Barren Land:

        -   7.1 Empty Lot —\> Super bright reflective surface

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.27.49%20PM-01.png){width="1000"}

        -   7.2 Empty Lot —\> Reddish brown empty lots

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.30.25%20PM.png){width="1000"}

        -   7.3 Open soil —\> Cemetery/Parks brown land

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.31.29%20PM.png){width="1000"}

    -   8 Shadow

        -   8.1 Shadow —\> Select shadow of buildings, trace them to their exact shape

            ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.32.43%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   After classifying, try to change the colours for each CID into their own colours and group them, to allow for easier visualisation.

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.33.36%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   This is the colour palette used by our group, in order of macro classes, stopping at Black for Shadow.

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.34.16%20PM.png)

-   Next, select all the points, and click on ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.34.53%20PM.png){width="43"} to see the spectral signature plot for the points

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.35.28%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   It will look something like this:

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.36.19%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   We can see that for most classes, they are grouped together. However, the red lines(Built-up 1 low-rise Houses) have a wide range of values, which is not what we want, and maybe creating an extra macro class to further classify them or hinting to reselect the polygons. Also, grey(roads), black(shadow) and light blue(water body) have similar values, hinting that they could be misclassified by the model.

-   Reminder that whenever you are attempting to add new points to the spectral plot, you should be deleting old ones first, or they may interfere with the data.

-   Next, when all the points are chosen and you are satisfied with them,  click ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.37.18%20PM.png){width="43"} and go back to the SCP dialogue window

-   Go to ‘Band ProcessingClassification’ this time and choose the correct band set that you are currently using. Select ‘Linear scaling’ and ‘Macroclass ID’ for training. Click ‘Run’ and save it as ‘2020-Train-data-1’.

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.37.55%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   When it is done, a new layer will be added to your project window, showing you the classification of the different land cover types

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.39.03%20PM.png){width="1000"}

-   Repeat this step until you are satisfied with the classification

-   Then, right click ‘SCP training layer’ and export it as shapefile and save it

-   Save, then click on ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.40.15%20PM.png){width="43"} to create a new set for the Test data called ‘2020-Test’

-   Ensure that the training shapefile layer is shown and visible, to ensure that you do not select the same area for both Training and Test

    ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%207.40.55%20PM.png)

-   Once done, export this layer into a shapefile too, called ‘2020-Test’

### 3.3 Conducting Accuracy Assessment for trained model

-   Next, we return to SCP dialogue window after clicking on ![](images/Screenshot 2025-04-19 at 7.42.55 PM.png){width="43"}

-   Go to ‘Postprocessing —\> Accuracy’

-   Select the train data file for  ‘Select the classification to assess’ and put the shapefile test layer into 'Select the reference vector or raster’. Click the ![](images/Screenshot 2025-04-19 at 7.43.55 PM.png){width="43"} button if the layers are not showing up, and change the ‘Vector field’ to ‘macroclass’. Click ‘Run’ and save it as ‘MLAccuracy2020’. After running, the Accuracy Assessment Report appears, showing 1. Long pair-wise error list 2. Confusion Matrix (Error Matrix) and 3. Kappa Hat Matrix. There will be an overall accuracy and an accuracy for each class.

    ![](images/Screenshot 2025-04-19 at 7.45.00 PM.png){width="1000"}
