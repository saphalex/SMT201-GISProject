# Methodology

## Land Cover Change Classification (Training, Testing and Selection)

Online

### Training

Copernicus

#### 1. Land Cover Types

#### 2. Fine Tuning with Standard Deviation

#### 3. Evaluation of Algorithms Using Spectral Distance

#### 4. Run SCP Classification on 2 Algorithm: Minimum Distance and Maximum Likelihood

### Training

#### 1. Add testing samples for each land cover type

#### 2. Calculate accuracy for both algorithm using the same test samples in previous step

#### 3. Selection of algorithm

#### 4. Retraining for PA less than 75%

### Final evaluation of classification model

### Output of Classification

#### 2020:
#### 2021:
#### 2022:
#### 2023:
#### 2024:
#### 2025:
