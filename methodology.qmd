# 4.0 Methodology

The following diagram details the flow of the methodology adopted to perform land cover change analysis in KL for all years applicable:

## 4.1 Data Collection

### 4.1.1 Area and Image Selection

After deciding that we would focus on KL for this project, we selected the relevant satellite imagery of the area from Copernicus. Importantly, we did not rely on a single image to scope out the area of interest for each year – instead, we ensured that the area was covered by 2 images: right coverage (“right tile”) and middle coverage (“middle tile”). The following table comprises of the image files downloaded from Copernicus for the sake of this project:

To ensure temporal consistency, we tried our best to ensure that the images had a minimum of a 12-month gap between the years (e.g. if we selected images in February for the year 2024, we would ensure that the preceding year’s images would be in either February or January). If this was not possible due to poor imaging or excessive cloud cover, we selected the most suitable image(s) that had the furthest time gap between itself and the following year’s image(s).

We also made sure that for the 2 images selected in each year, they were captured within 1 month of each other and that the quality of the middle tile was prioritised over that of the right tile for any given year’s sample to ensure consistency and quality. Additionally, for any and all images selected, we kept the cloud cover to a minimum. By balancing all these factors, we were able to select the most suitable images for our analysis.

![The above image shows a side-by-side comparison of the middle tiles selected for 2023 and 2022 that have a time gap of 14 months. This is one of a few outliers from the criteria we had defined for selecting the images.](images/Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 11.19.13 PM.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 4.1.2 Vector & Raster Layer Selections

### 4.2 Image Pre-processing

## 4.3 Identification & Categorisation of Land Classes

Using the false and true colour composites obtained as well as the OpenStreetMap trimmed to overlap with the KL subzone boundary, we identified the following land classes and subclasses: 

#### 3. Evaluation of Algorithms Using Spectral Distance

#### 4. Run SCP Classification on 2 Algorithm: Minimum Distance and Maximum Likelihood

### Training

#### 1. Add testing samples for each land cover type

#### 2. Calculate accuracy for both algorithm using the same test samples in previous step

#### 3. Selection of algorithm

#### 4. Retraining for PA less than 75%

### Final evaluation of classification model

### Output of Classification

#### 2021:

#### 2022:

#### 2023:

#### 2024:

#### 2025:
