# 4.0 Methodology

The following diagram details the flow of the methodology adopted to perform land cover change analysis in KL for all years applicable:

## 4.1 Data Collection

### 4.1.1 Area and Image Selection

After deciding that we would focus on KL for this project, we selected the relevant satellite imagery of the area from Copernicus. Importantly, we did not rely on a single image to scope out the area of interest for each year – instead, we ensured that the area was covered by 2 images: right coverage (“right tile”) and middle coverage (“middle tile”). The following table comprises of the image files downloaded from Copernicus for the sake of this project:

![*Image files downloaded from Copernicus*](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%2011.46.05%20AM.png){fig-align="center"}

![*The above image shows the 2 tiles selected for the analysis of the KL region in 2023*](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%206.45.54%20PM.png)

![*The above image shows the 2 tiles selected for the analysis of the KL region in 2022*](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%206.49.00%20PM.png){fig-align="center"}

![*The above image shows the 2 tiles selected for the analysis of the KL region in 2021*](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%208.49.38%20PM.png){fig-align="center"}

To ensure temporal consistency, we tried our best to ensure that the images had a minimum of a 12-month gap between the years (e.g. if we selected images in February for the year 2024, we would ensure that the preceding year’s images would be in either February or January). If this was not possible due to poor imaging or excessive cloud cover, we selected the most suitable image(s) that had the furthest time gap between itself and the following year’s image(s).

![The above image shows the right tiles selected for 2024 and 2023. An image in March was selected for 2023 due to the lack of good imaging in January/February.](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%2011.17.55%20PM.png){fig-align="center"}

We also made sure that for the 2 images selected in each year, they were captured within 1 month of each other and that the quality of the middle tile was prioritised over that of the right tile for any given year’s sample to ensure consistency and quality. Additionally, for any and all images selected, we kept the cloud cover to a minimum. By balancing all these factors, we were able to select the most suitable images for our analysis.

![The above image shows a side-by-side comparison of the middle tiles selected for 2023 and 2022 that have a time gap of 14 months. This is one of a few outliers from the criteria we had defined for selecting the images.](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%2011.19.13%20PM.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 4.1.2 Vector & Raster Layer Selections

We obtained shapefiles for Malaysia through [geoBoundaries.org](http://geoboundaries.org). We first selected the KL boundary from the entire Malaysia map and exported the selected feature to obtain the vector layer.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%208.30.35%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

Although there were many subzone areas connected to areas outside of KL when overlaying both layers, we still decided to Clip them to preserve the shape of the boundary so that it matches with the boundaries from OpenStreetMap, and also since it was the only open-sourced dataset that contained the sub boundaries for KL.

### 4.2 Image Pre-processing

Next, for the raster layers, we wanted to combine both the middle and right raster layers with each other. Due to some possible overlapping of images, we did not use the ‘Merge’ function as it gave significantly larger pixel values (reflectance values up to 19000) and used ‘Build Virtual Raster’ instead. We combined the Middle and Right images for each band (bands 2,3,4,8).

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%208.33.08%20PM.png){width="800"}

We then clipped them by Mask Extent to the KL Map to obtain the relevant image needed for KL

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%208.34.05%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

![]()After obtaining the layers for all 4 10m resolution bands, we then used the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP Plugin) to put them together as a band set. By changing the RGB to 3-2-1 (using bands 4,3, then 2), we are able to obtain the True Composite Image (TCI) for the band set. The 

TCI allows a quick visual inspection of the land cover types, and allows identification of roads from vegetation, water bodies like reservoirs and rivers, as well as forested areas and bare land

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-19%20at%208.35.29%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

![]()Then by changing the RGB to 4-3-2 (using bands 8,4, then 3), we are able to obtain the False Composite (FCC) for the band set. The FCC shows vegetation as bright red/pink, urban areas as blue/grey and water bodies as black/dark blue. It can show vegetation clearly and allows impervious surfaces mapping.

## 4.3 Identification & Categorisation of Land Classes

Using the false and true colour composites obtained as well as the OpenStreetMap trimmed to overlap with the KL subzone boundary, we identified the following land classes and subclasses:

1.  Natural Vegetation

    -   Sub-class 1: Forests (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20at%2011.27.23%20PM.png){width="38"})

2.  Managed Vegetation

    -   Sub-class 1: Golf Course grass (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.27.45%20AM.png){width="38"})

    -   Sub-class 2: Sports Field (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.29.03%20AM.png){width="38"})

3.  Water Body

    -   Sub-class 1: Flood Reservoir (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.30.47%20AM.png){width="38"})

    -   Sub-class 2: Lakes (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.31.45%20AM.png){width="38"})

    -   Sub-class 3: Rivers (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.32.39%20AM.png){width="38" height="38"})

4.  Impervious Surfaces

    -   Sub-class 1: Roads (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.34.41%20AM.png){width="38"})

5.  Built-up 1 (low-rise buildings)

    -   Sub-class 1: Houses (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.36.10%20AM.png){width="38"})

6.  Built-up 2 (high-rise buildings) 

    -   Sub-class 1: Buildings (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20at%2012.37.35%20AM.png){width="38"})

7.  Barren Land

    -   Sub-class 1: Empty Lot (Reflective Surfaces) (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%2011.37.46%20AM.png){width="38"})

    -   Sub-class 2: Empty Lot (Reddish-Brown Surfaces) (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%2011.38.19%20AM.png){width="38"})

    -   Sub-class 3: Open Soil (Cemeteries/Parks) (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%2011.39.52%20AM.png){width="38"})

8.  Shadow

    -   Sub-class 1: Shadows of Buildings (represented on the following spectral plots by ![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%2011.40.43%20AM.png){width="38"})

Therefore, there are a total of 13 sub-classes that we have identified which require training and test data to be selected for. To create the training and test data sets, we utilised the ROI polygon creation feature present in the SCP plug-in, with each polygon representing a data point. For each subclass, we created approximately 80 data points for the training data set and 35 data points for the test data set. Ultimately, the ratio of training data to test data roughly mimicked a 70%-30% split and they must be saved in the correct format (ESRI Shapefiles). This process must be repeated for each year within the selected time frame.

## 4.4 Classification & Accuracy Assessment using SCP Plugin

After creating training and test data sets for the relevant subclasses, we use the SCP plugin to perform classification using the “post-processing” feature on the selected area:

After classifying the area based on the training and test data, the following accuracy results were obtained for each year: 

[**2024**]{.underline}

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%201.14.59%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1008"}

**Overall Accuracy: 81.3%**

**Kappa Hat classification: 0.759**

\

[**2023**]{.underline}

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%201.17.02%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1008"}

**Overall Accuracy: 61.4%**

**Kappa Hat classification: 0.522**

\

[**2022**]{.underline}

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%201.18.16%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1008"}

**Overall Accuracy: 40.4%**

**Kappa Hat classification: 0.286**

\

[**2021**]{.underline}

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%201.19.13%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1008"}

**Overall Accuracy: 72.3%**

**Kappa Hat classification: 0.650**

[**2020**]{.underline}

![](images/Screenshot%202025-04-16%20at%201.20.52%20PM.png){fig-align="center" width="1008"}

**Overall Accuracy: 53.1%**

**Kappa Hat classification: 0.452**

\
It is advisable for the overall accuracy value of the classification to be 70% or greater and for the Kappa Hat classification value to be 0.65 or greater to ensure that the classification output provides us with the best analysis possible. However, we were unable to obtain these values for many of the years despite taking multiple training/test samples that were distributed across the selected region, which could therefore mean that the accuracy defect was due to poor image quality for selected years. Such shortcomings will be further elaborated in the Limitations section.
